# SQL and ML Projects

This repository will host a **growing collection of portfolio projects** focused on SQL, machine learning and data analysis.  
The focus is on **end-to-end analytical workflows** – from raw data and feature engineering to model evaluation and business insights.

Currently it includes:

- **InsuranceChargesPrediction_ML** – a regression project predicting medical insurance charges based on demographic and lifestyle features (Python, scikit-learn, Pandas). The project demonstrates a clean modeling workflow using pipelines, GridSearchCV and RMSE evaluation, as well as interpretation of key cost drivers (e.g. smoking status, BMI, age).

## What I focus on here

The focus of this repository is on:

- building **reproducible analytical workflows** (clean structure, clear steps),
- combining **technical modeling skills** (SQL, ML) with **business-oriented insights**,
- creating projects that can be easily reviewed and reused by others (well-documented notebooks, readable SQL, concise summaries).
